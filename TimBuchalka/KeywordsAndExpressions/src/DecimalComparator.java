/* Rounding to Three Decimal Places: Remember that to compare doubles up to three decimal places, you need to round both values to three decimal places. This is achieved by multiplying the numbers by 1000 and converting them to long. This is because 1000 corresponds to three decimal places (i.e., 1.234 * 1000 = 1234).*/
